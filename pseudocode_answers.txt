Why do programmers use pseudocode?
Programmers use pseudocode to break down a problem into easy to understand steps. 

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
Nothing. Pseudocode is usually in your preferred spoken language, therefore the computer cannot read it.

Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than second number THEN
	PRINT first number
ELSE IF second number is greater than first number THEN
	PRINT second number
END IF

Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
INIT i to 1
WHILE i is less than or equal to 100
	PRINT i
	ADD 1 to i

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
(Since it is a phone book, I assume it is alphabetical order and the function will return true if it is found.)

INPUT entry
INPUT phonebook
INIT l to 0
INIT r to length of phonebook
WHILE l < r:
	INIT m to (r + l) / 2
	INIT x to mth element of phonebook
	IF x is to the left of entry:
		SET l to m + 1
	ELSE IF x is to the right of entry:
		SET r to m
	ELSE:
		RETURN true
RETURN false
	

Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.
(Javascript)

function search(phonebook, entry){
	let l = 0;
	let r = phonebook.length;

	while(l < r ){
		let m = Math.floor((l+r)/2);
    		let x = phonebook[m];
    		if(x < entry){
    			l = m+1;
    		}else if(x > entry){
    			r = m;
    		}else{
    			return true;
    		}
	}
	return false;
}
